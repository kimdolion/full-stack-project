# Void-Yeet-Backend
    A fullstack SPA built during General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.
    A simple CRUD with one to many resource relationships.
    This is an app you can use to catalog and throw away negative thoughts/feelings in a more fun way.
    To be more specific, to yeet the bad thoughts into the darkness, where they can live away from you, or be permanently deleted.
